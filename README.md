##Description<br>
This is a project for my computer science 359 course.  In this, I plan on implementing a RISKesh style system in which pieces are placed on each region and the players roll dice in order to attack other regions.  A system of cards is planned on being implemented in order to bring in a little extra spice of life.  If I get really daring, I would like to implement and AI as well as networking as a part of this game.<br>
